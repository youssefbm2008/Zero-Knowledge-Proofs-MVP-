This repository is for the project of building a zero-knowledge sdk

## Problem Statement

Recent break-throughs allow the use of zero-knowledge proofs in real-world applications. Such proofs have the potential to assert a computation while keeping the statement hidden. However, zero-knowledge proofs are currently not widely utilised because there is no simple interface which allows non-expert security software developers to use these assertions in their applications.
  
## Solution

We develop a simple interface that allows any non-expert software developer to include assertions of zero-knowledge 


 We develop a simple, easy-to-use API/SDK that allows a software developer to include zero-knowledge proofs in their applications. 
 
 ### What exactly do we want to build?
 #### Short Term - MVP
 ##### Market Monopolisation
 
 #### Long Term
 

## One Liners

  * Zero-Knowledge Proofs --- Now accessible for everyone 
  * Zero. Knowledge. Proofs. We turned the impossible into something super simple.
  * Zero-Knowledge Proofs --- Now, super simple
  * Zero-Knowledge Proofs --- Complex? Now, super simple!

## License 

Learning result: software developers (security minded) want to see the code they are working on

  * Common Creatives: Non-Disclosure License (CC NC) --- restricts the use of the software to non-commercial use
      - pitfalls: someone may release a non-commercial product using our sdk
    
  * Open-sourced limited versions (closed-source of the rest of the library)
     a) limiting efficiency
     b) open-sourcing only parts of the software - counter-intuitive?
     c) limiting functionality - closed-source of other functionality? 
      - pitfalls: doesn't necessarily solve the trust problem?

  * Black box model --- closed source
    - pitfalls: might hinder software developers from using the software; trust issues; outreach
